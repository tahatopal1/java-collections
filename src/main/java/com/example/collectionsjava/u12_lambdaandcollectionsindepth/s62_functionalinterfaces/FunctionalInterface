Intro - What is a Functional Interface

    ->  Definition: An interface that contains only one abstract method.
    ->  Purpose: Functional interfaces are used to invoke lambda expressions.
    ->  Java examples:
            ->  Runnable; with the abstract method 'run'
            ->  Comparable; with the abstract method 'compareTo'
            ->  Callable; with the abstract method 'call'

Key Points

    ->  Single Abstract Method: A functional interface must have exactly one abstract method.
    ->  Java 8 Additions: From Java 8 onwards, interfaces can also have:
        ->  Default methods
        ->  Static methods
    ->  Restriction: The restriction applies only to abstract methods, there can be any number of default and static
    methods in a functional interface.
