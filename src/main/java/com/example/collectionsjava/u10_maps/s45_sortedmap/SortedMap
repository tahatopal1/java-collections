Intro

    'SortedMap' is a sub-interface of the 'Map' interface that stores key-value pairs in a sorted order based on
the keys.


Key Characteristics

    1) Sorted Order

        ->  Stores key-value pairs in ascending order of the keys.
        ->  The sorting is based on the keys, not the values.

    2) No Null Keys or Values

        ->  SortedMap does not allow null keys or null values.

    3) Sorting Mechanism

        ->  Keys are sorted either by their natural ordering or by a specific comparator provided at map creation time.

Methods of SortedMap Interface

    Comparator<? super K> comparator(): Returns the comparator used to order the keys in the map, or null if the map
uses the natural ordering of its keys.

    SortedMap<K, V> subMap(K fromKey, K toKey): Returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys range from 'fromKey'
, inclusive,to 'toKey' exclusive.

    SortedMap<K, V> headMap(K toKey): Returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are strictly less than 'toKey'

    SortedMap<K, V> tailMap(K fromKey): Returns a view of the portion of the map whose keys are greater or equal to
'fromKey'

    K firstKey(): Returns the first (lowest) key currently in the map.

    K lastKey(): Returns the last (highest) key currently in the map.

    Set<K> keySet(): Returns a 'Set' view of the keys contained in this map.

    Collection<V> values(): Returns a 'Collection' view of the values in this map.

    Set<Map.Entry<K, V>> entrySet(): Returns a 'Set' view of the mappings contained in this map.
