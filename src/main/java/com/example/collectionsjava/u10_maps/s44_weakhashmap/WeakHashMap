Intro

    WeakHashMap is similar to HashMap but with a few key differences, especially concerning garbage collection.

Key Differences

    1) Garbage Collection

        HashMap:

            ->  Objects used as keys in a 'HashMap' are strongly referenced. As long as a key is present in the HashMap
        it is not eligible for garbage collection.

        WeakHashMap:

            ->  Objects used as keys in a 'WeakHashMap' are weakly referenced. If a key has no strong reference
        elsewhere in the application, it is eligible for garbage collection and once collected, the corresponding entry
        is removed from the WeakHashMap

    2) Interfaces Implemented

        HashMap:

            ->  Implements 'Serializable' and 'Cloneable' interfaces.

        WeakHashMap:

            ->  Does not implement 'Serializable' and 'Cloneable' interfaces. Therefore, WeakHashMap cannot be
        serialized or cloned.
