Intro

    TreeMap is an implementation of the NavigableMap, SortedMap and Map interfaces. It also extends the AbstractMap
class.

Key Characteristics

    1) Underlying Data Structure

        ->  The underlying data structure of a TreeMap is Red-Black Tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree.

    2) Sorting Order

        ->  TreeMap does not preserve the insertion order. Instead, it stores the key-value pairs in a sorted order
    based on the keys.

    3) Duplicate Keys

        ->  Duplicate keys are not allowed, but values can be duplicated.

    4) Homogeneous and Comparable Keys

        ->  If using the default natural sorting order, the keys must be homogeneous and comparable.
        ->  If using a custom comparator, the keys do not need to be homogeneous or comparable.

    5) Null Keys

        ->  TreeMap does not allow null keys as of Java version 1.6. Null values are allowed.
