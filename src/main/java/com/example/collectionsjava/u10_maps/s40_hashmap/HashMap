Intro

    'HashMap' is a data structure for storing key-value pairs.

Internal Working

    ->  A 'HashMap' uses an array of buckets (nodes) to store key-value pairs.
    ->  The hash code of a key determines the bucket where the key-pair is stored.
    ->  If two keys have the same hash code, they are stored in the same bucket using a linked list.
    ->  The initial array size is 16, and it grows dynamically as elements are added (resize happens when 75% of the
array is filled.)
