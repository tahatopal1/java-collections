Intro

    It is similar to 'HashMap' in terms of storing key-value pairs and having similar methods and constructors, but
it has a crucial difference in how it handles key comparison.

Key Difference

    1) Key Comparison

        HashMap:

            ->  Uses the 'equals' method to compare keys. It checks if the values of the keys are equal.

        IdentityHashMap:

            ->  Uses the '==' operator to compare keys. It checks if the references (memory addresses) of the keys are
        equal.

    2) Duplicate Keys

        HashMap:

            ->  Does not allow duplicate keys based on the 'equals' method.

        IdentityHashMap:

            ->  Does not allow duplicate keys based on the '==' operator.
