Improved Locking Mechanism

    The newly added concurrent collections in Java use an improved locking mechanism in a multithreading environment.
While the old collections block the entire object, the new concurrent collections enhance performance by locking only
specific segments of the collection instead of the whole object. This segment-based locking significantly improves the
performance by allowing more fine-grained control over which parts of the collection are locked during operations.

Key Benefits of Concurrent Collections

    1) Improved Performance: By locking only particular segments of the collection, concurrent collections reduce
contention between threads, allowing more efficient access and modification.

    2) Handling Concurrent Modification: Concurrent collections address the issue of 'ConcurrentModificationException'
by allowing multiple threads to modify the collection simultaneously without causing inconsistencies.

Why Use Concurrent Collections?

    1) Enhanced Scalability: They support higher levels of concurrency by reducing the scope of locking.

    2) Thread Safety: They ensure that multiple threads can work on the collection simultaneously without corrupting
the data.

    3) Consistency: They maintain data consistency even when multiple threads perform read and write operations
concurrently.
