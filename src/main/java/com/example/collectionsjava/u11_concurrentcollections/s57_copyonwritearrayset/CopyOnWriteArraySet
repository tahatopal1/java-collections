Intro

    As its name implies, CopyOnWriteArraySet is a concurrent version of a Set. It is built on top of the
CopyOnWriteArrayList, meaning it shares the same internal mechanism.

   ->   Write Operations: These are performed on a cloned copy of the array.
   ->   Read Operations: These are done on the main array.
   ->   Synchronization: After any update, the JVM internally synchronizes the cloned copy with the main array.

Key Characteristics

    ->  Fail-Safe: This collection is fail-safe, avoiding 'ConcurrentModificationException' during iteration.
    ->  Unique Elements: Unlike CopyOnWriteArrayList, it ensures all elements are unique, as it adheres to Set interface
