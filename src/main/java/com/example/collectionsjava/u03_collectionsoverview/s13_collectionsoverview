Array
  - Fixed in size
  - Can only hold homogeneous type
  - Memory point of view, we should not use 'Arrays'
  - There are no underlying data structures
  - Would be more performant if size is determined
  - No out of the box methods to use
  - Can hold primitive type and object type both

Collection
  - Collections are growable in nature
  - Can hold homogeneous or heterogeneous
  - Recommended to use to stop memory wastage as it grows in demand
  - In built data structure and algorithms
  - Wouldn't be performant if size is determined
  - Even though size is fixed, it's too handy with easy to use methods
  - Can only hold object types
