Concept of Arraylist

    Collection: Used to hold and transfer group of objects
    Serializable: Objects must implement this interface to be sent across a network
    Cloneable: Allows creating duplicate objects for operations and comparisons

Key interfaces implemented by ArrayList

    1. Serializable: Ensures objects can be serialized
    2. Cloneable: Enables creation of duplicate objects
    3. Random Access:
        * Marker interface (no methods)
        * Indicates support for fast random access
        * Useful for frequent retrieval operations

ArrayList operations

    Retrieval: Efficient due to the Random Access Interface
    Insertion/Deletion:
        * Not recommended for middle positions
        * Involves shifting of elements, which is time-consuming
        * Can cause creation of a new ArrayList if size exceeds capacity

Summary

    * Best for retrieval: Due to fast access capabilities.
    * Not ideal for frequent insertion and deletion: Due to overhead of shifting elements.
