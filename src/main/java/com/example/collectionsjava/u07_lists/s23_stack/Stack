Intro

    'Stack' is a subclass of 'Vector' that implements the stack data structure. The Stack class adheres to
Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one removed. It inherits all
characteristics from Vector, such as allowing duplicate elements, preserving insertion order and accepting
heterogeneous objects.

Characteristics

    -> Stack follows LIFO
    -> Inherits properties of Vector, such as following duplicates, preserving insertion order and accepting
heterogeneous objects.
    -> The methods of the Stack class are specific to stack operations but also include methods from 'Collection'
and 'List' interfaces.
