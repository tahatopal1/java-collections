Intro

    The 'SortedSet' interface extends the 'Set' interface, inheriting its properties and adding additional ones
to maintain a sorted order of elements.

Characteristics

    ->  Maintains elements in a specific sorting order
    ->  No duplicate values
    ->  No insertion order, but elements are sorted based on their natural ordering or a provided comparator
    ->  Doesn't allow heterogeneous elements (Throws error on runtime)
