Intro

    'LinkedHashSet' is a subclass of 'HashSet'. It preserves the insertion order of elements while maintaining
the properties of a HashSet. It's a combination of a hash table and linked list underneath.

    LinkedHashSet preserves the insertion order by maintaining a linked list whereas it leverages a hash table
to ensure an efficient searching. In this regard, it uses linked list when traversing and uses hash table when
conducting a search. LinkedHashSet is more bulky than the HashSet as it maintains two different data structures.

The LinkedHashSet inherits all methods from the Collection interface.
