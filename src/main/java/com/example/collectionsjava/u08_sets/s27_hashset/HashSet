Intro

    HashSet is an implementation of Set interface. HashSet is ideal for situations where searching is frequent,
as it leverages hashing, the fastest algorithm for searching operations. The underlying data structure of 'HashSet'
is a hash table, which allows efficient data retrieval.

    The LinkedHashSet inherits all methods from the Collection interface.

Key Points

1) Characteristics of 'HashSet'

    -> Duplicates: Not allowed.
    -> Insertion Order: Not preserved.
    -> Heterogeneous Elements: Allowed.
    -> Null Values: Allowed.
    -> Interfaces Implemented: Serializable, Cloneable

2) Hashing and Hash Table

    -> Hashing: Generates a hash code for each object.
    -> Hash Table: Uses hash codes to determine the index where the objects are stored
