Definition

    ->  A raw type is a generic class or interface used without type arguments.

Raw Types and Compatibility

    ->  Raw types retained for backward compatibility with older Java versions.
    ->  Using raw types is not type-safe and may cause runtime errors and require type casting.

Best Practices

    ->  Avoiding using raw types when dealing with single type collections.
    ->  Use parameterized types if mixed types are needed to avoid raw type warnings.

Conclusion

    ->  Understanding raw types is important for maintaining and updating legacy code.
    ->  Using generics ensures type safety and reduces runtime errors.
